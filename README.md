# How to Register & Add New Pages?

Within the ``/Configs/Pages.config.php``, you can add your pages to the ``$PAG3R_PAGES`` array:

```PHP
$PAG3R_PAGES = array(
"Page Name"=>"Page Name:filename.php:icon-chevron-right",
"Page Name2"=>"Page Name2:filename2.php:icon-chevron-right",
"Page Name3"=>"Page Name3:filename3.php:icon-chevron-right"
);
```

Now navigate to ``/Pages/`` and create your new file, e.g. ``filename.php``, which stands for "Page Name", because we've just added to the array.

# How to Edit or Change the Navbar?

If you like, you can easily edit the navigation bar, where the pages are displayed. In order to do so, create a new folder, e.g. `YOURDESIGN` in ``/Designs/`` and then edit the ``/Designs/YOURDESIGN/navbar.php``. If you are using the default design, the path is ``/Designs/Default/navbar.php``. The default ``navbar.php`` source code is as follows:

```PHP
require_once('./Configs/Pages.config.php');

foreach($PAG3R_PAGES as $page){
$parts = explode(':', $page);
					
if (strpos($_GET['p'], $parts[1])!== false){
echo ' <li class="active">';
}else{
echo '<li>';
}
echo '<a href="./index.php?p=' . $parts[1] . '"><i class="' . $parts[2] . '"></i> ' . $parts[0] . '</a>  </li>';
}
```

# Configurate the Framework

Just jump to ``/Configs/Framework.config.php`` there you can change the required settings to run the Pag3rÂ´s Framework correctly.

# How to Protect the Files?

If you want to protect a file from directly accessing, just add to the top of the file this code:

```PHP
if(!defined('Pag3r-Framework')) {
   die('[Pag3r Framework] >> Direct access not permitted');
}
```

# How to Create My Own Plugin?

Go to the ``/Plugins/`` folder and create a new directory , e.g. ``/YOURPLUGIN/``. Then navigate in to the ``/Plugins/YOURPLUGIN/`` directory and create the file ``Plugin.pag3r.php``. This will be your main plugin class, where you write your code, for example:

```PHP
function YOURPLUGIN_generateRandomString($length = 10) {
    $characters = '0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ';
    $charactersLength = strlen($characters);
    $randomString = '';
    for ($i = 0; $i < $length; $i++) {
        $randomString .= $characters[rand(0, $charactersLength - 1)];
    }
    return $randomString;
}
```

In order to avoid conflicts, please prefix your function name with the name of your Plugin, like in this example. Now you can use your new function from everywhere; Just call ``YOURPLUGIN_generateRandomString();``.

# Updates

I will go and add an Admin CMS soon, the PluginIncluder is now working.
