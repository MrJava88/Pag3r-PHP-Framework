$PAG3R_PAGES = array("Page Name"=>"Page Name:filename.php:icon-chevron-right");
```

```PHP
$PAG3R_PAGES = array(
"Page Name"=>"Page Name:filename.php:icon-chevron-right",
"Page Name2"=>"Page Name2:filename2.php:icon-chevron-right",
"Page Name3"=>"Page Name3:filename3.php:icon-chevron-right"

If you like you can easy edit the navigationbar where the pages are displayed, for that just go to ``/Designs/*YOUR DESIGN*/navbar.php`` if you are using the Default design the path is ``/Designs/Default/navbar.php``, the Default ``navbar.php`` source code is
```PHP
require_once('./Configs/Pages.config.php');

foreach($PAG3R_PAGES as $page){
$parts = explode(':', $page);
					
if (strpos($_GET['p'], $parts[1])!== false){
echo ' <li class="active">';
}else{
echo '<li>';
}
echo '<a href="./index.php?p=' . $parts[1] . '"><i class="' . $parts[2] . '"></i> ' . $parts[0] . '</a>  </li>';
}
```
